### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm an undergraduate student at San Francisco State University I am eager to learn from experienced professionals in the industry and apply my skills to real-world challenges. I am a quick learner, an effective communicator, and a collaborative team player, and I believe that my attention to detail and ability to work under pressure make me a strong fit for the role.
